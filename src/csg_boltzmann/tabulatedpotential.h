/**
 * \brief Tabulated Potential calculates histograms of bead interactions
 *
 * There are two histograms that can be created:
 *
 * * the first is a potential distribution table specified with the 'tab'
 * keyword (for table). This uses boltzmann inversion to calculate the
 * potential from a selection of bead interactions.
 *
 * * the second is a histogram of the beads interactions specified with the
 * 'hist' keyword.
 *
 * As an example let us assume we already have a BondedStatistics object named
 * 'bonded_statistics' with the correct data. We can write a histogram of the
 * interactions using the following commands:
 *
 *     TabulatedPotential tabulated_potential;
 *
 *     map<string,AnalysisTool *> commands;
 *     tabulated_potential.Register(commands);
 *
 *     vector<string> arguments{"set","n","11"};
 *
 *     tabulated_potential.Command(bonded_statistics,"hist",arguments);
 *
 *     vector<string> interactions{"file1.txt","bond1","bond2","bond3",...};
 *     tabulated_potential.Command(bonded_statistics,"hist",interactions);
 *
 * The above example creates the object it then proceeds to set one of the
 * properties of the histogram. In this case the number of data points is
 * specified with the keyword 'n', the 11 indicates we want the histogram to
 * consist of 11 bins. To actually create the histogram the Command method is
 * called a second time but because the 'set' keyword is not the first element
 * in the vector of strings the tabulated potential object assumes it is a file
 * name were the histogram will be written. The following labels ("bond1",
 * "bond2", etc...) specify the interactions to be sorted into the histogram.
 * Running this code should produce a file named file1.txt containing two
 * columns.
 *
 * column1 = the bin edge, column2 = the contents of the histogram
 *
 * If the table potential is printed instead of the historgram of interactions
 * than 3 columns are printed e.g. in the example below:
 *
 *     TabulatedPotential tabulated_potential;
 *
 *     map<string,AnalysisTool *> commands;
 *     tabulated_potential.Register(commands);
 *
 *     vector<string> arguments{"set","T","275"};
 *     vector<string> arguments2{"set","smooth_pot","1"};
 *     vector<string> arguments3{"set","periodic","1"};
 *
 *     tabulated_potential.Command(bonded_statistics,"tab",arguments);
 *     tabulated_potential.Command(bonded_statistics,"tab",arguments1);
 *     tabulated_potential.Command(bonded_statistics,"tab",arguments2);
 *
 *     vector<string> interactions{"file2.txt","bond1","bond2","bond3",...};
 *     tabulated_potential.Command(bonded_statistics,"tab",interactions);
 *
 * Here, notice we are using the 'tab' keyword to indicate it is for the
 * tabulated potential. We are also setting several properities. The temperature
 * is changed from the default 300 Kelvin to 275 Kelvin. Smooth potential is set
 * to 1 this has the affect of smoothing the potential after boltzmann inversion
 * is done. If a value greater than 1 were used it would smooth the data several
 * times upto the number specified. And the final setting was to make the
 * tabulated potential periodic. The value "1" is converted to a boolean which
 * is interpreted as true.
 *
 * Finally, the data is printed to a file called "file2.txt" which contains
 * three columns:
 *
 * column1 = the bin edge, column2 = potential, column3 = the force
