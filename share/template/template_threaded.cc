// to sum it up: instead of having one "thread" doing all your work (the whole
// tracetory), you may split it into single frames and distribute it among many
// "workers". a solid choice is: number of cores = number of workers. you, as
// the user, are required to define how to initialize and merge your workers.
// the main part of the program, EvalConfiguration, is shifted to the Worker
// class but other than that stays untouched compared to a non-threaded version

  // executed) after MergeWorker exits, the mutex is unlocked
  //        rdfMutex.Unlock();
  // and allows other threads to get a lock and start merging

  // now follows your code
