   \brief Observer class for analysis hook

   Each application which performs analysis operations should use CGEngine. It
   offers a hook (callback class) during the coarse-graining process to evaluate
   each frame. The user does not have to take care about mapping and other
   stoff. Just oberload this class and analyze properties of interest.
